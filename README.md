## Encryption/decryption script
A script to simulate the generation of keys and encryption/decryption a number by them.

## Usage
This script requires python 3. version.
To run it, type:
```bash
python main.py
```

## TODOs:
- Implement elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) class and methods.

## Important notice
THIS SCRIPT IS DESIGNED FOR LEARNING ON E.G. COURSES ONLY
AND IT IS ILL-ADVISED TO USE IT FOR PRIVATE OR BUSINESS PURPOSES.
THE LENGTH OF KEYS IS SMALL (LIKE 16 bit) AND CAN BE HACKED EASILY WHAT CAN BE SEEN BY RUNNING E.G.:
```python
crypto.brute_force_hack(encrypted_value)
```
